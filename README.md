#Student-Mentor-Guidance-System
  
In these trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic, Students may go through hardships to cope up with their studies and
teachers may find it difficult to handle a lot of students simultaneously. So, our proposed system makes this task easier for
teachers/mentors and allocates them an equal amount of students depending upon the strength of the class. The total
number of students in the class or an organization gets distributed equally to the mentors of respective subjects.
